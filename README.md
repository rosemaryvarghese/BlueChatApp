BlueTwoChat is a safe and secure way to communicate with other Bluetooth-enabled devices. This application will first look for nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices. Once the devices have been discovered by the app, the app will display the discovered devices so that the user can choose which device to connect to.

If the user wants to connect to a new (unpaired) device, they must first pair it with their device. The linked devices may share data when the user initiates the connection and once the connection is established. To make the app safer, this data will be encrypted using a specific encryption technique.

This app interacts using the client-server model, in which one device acts as the server and the other as the client. The app will be created in such a way that it allows for the safe and secure transmission of data across devices by utilizing encryption methods such as the AES encryption algorithm to ensure data security.
